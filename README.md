# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview
Creates a summary DataFrame of the PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, creates a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban).


## Results

### Fares By City Type
Rural riders pay the highest average fares at $34.62 per ride. Conversly, the represent the fewest rides at 125 rides.
Urban riders pay the lowest average fares at $24.53 per ride. However, the make up the bulk of the total fares and the most rides

### Weekly Fares
Fares between January 1, 2019 and April 30th, 2019 were examined:

Weekly flunctuations in fare totals between the 3 city types are considerably similar. 
For example, all 3 city type saw a peak in the 4th week of February. 
However, the month of March, in which Urban weekly fares were turbulent is an outlier in this regard. 

Urban totals are consistently the highest at about $2000/week.
Suburban totals are consistntly in the middle at about $1000/week.
Rural totals are consistently the lowest at about $750/week. 

## Summary

While ridership in Urban areas remain strong, I recommend that PyBer expands on the suburban markets. 
Suburban markets, like rural markets return a high fare per ride factor while still having a substantial ridership.
